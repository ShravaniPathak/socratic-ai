# **Socratic Teaching Assistant**

## **Project Overview**

The **Socratic Teaching Assistant** is a Gen AI-powered tool designed to enhance the learning experience of students by employing the **Socratic method**. This approach encourages critical thinking through probing questions, rather than simply providing answers. The tool focuses specifically on teaching **Data Structures and Algorithms**, making it a valuable resource for students and software engineers alike.

## **Problem Statement**

The traditional Socratic method, while effective, faces challenges in scaling for broader educational purposes. This project seeks to overcome those challenges by leveraging AI technology to facilitate a personalized learning experience. By focusing on a specific topic—**Algorithms of Sorting**—our assistant will guide users through the thought process, asking questions to help them arrive at answers independently.

## **Features**

- **Engaging Interaction:** The assistant asks probing questions that lead to deeper understanding.
- **Tailored Learning:** Adapts to the user's level of knowledge, providing personalized guidance.
- **Interactive Scenarios:** Users apply what they've learned in real-time, optimizing their solutions through conversation.
- **Iterative Learning:** A back-and-forth dialogue that helps students understand complex concepts.

**Usage**
---------

1.  Ask a technical question related to **Data Structures** or **Algorithms**.
2.  The assistant will guide you through the learning process by asking relevant questions.
3.  Engage in the dialogue until you reach a deeper understanding of the topic.

**Code Overview**
-----------------

The application consists of:

-   **Flask Backend:** Handles API requests and serves HTML templates.
-   **HTML/CSS Frontend:** Provides an interactive user interface for input and output.

### **Main Files**

-   `app.py`: The main Flask application code.
-   `templates/`: Directory containing HTML files for the frontend.
-   `static/css/`: Directory for stylesheets.
